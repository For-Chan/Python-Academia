# Python-Academia
Python Projects from my coursework

Repository will contain a list of Python projects and associated files from my academic coursework in Cyber Operations.
Scripts posted are only a snapshot in time and hopefully reflects my coding journey through the program.
Attempting to only share scripts that are "spruced up" to be inclusive of secure coding practices and projects of interesting.

...but who am I kidding? From what I've learned, Python coding is just a buncha accessing 3rd-party libraries...

So enjoy, all code in this repo is "The Unlicensed". Whatever that means.
